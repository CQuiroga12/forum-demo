      <h2>Emergence of Surveillance Technology</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout past couple of decades, increase in campus crimes and school shootings has led administrators and campus safety to seek new methods of surveillance
        in hopes of providing a safer campus. Today, these methods range from body-worn cameras to gunshot detectors, automated license plate readers to advanced
        biometric software. While these technologies were sought with the intention of providing a safer campus
        and preventing crimes, they often end up used for other purposes and fail to respect students’ privacy. The following are examples of the technology used on 
        college campuses: Body-worn cameras, Drones, Automated License Plate Reader, Social Media Monitoring, Biometric Identification, Gunshot Detection, and Video Analytics.

    <h2>Use of Surveillance Technology</h2>
    <p>
      In July 2020, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) launched a database of 7,000+ surveillance 
      technologies determined that campus police have adopted new technologies used by law enforcement agencies
      in the United States. This study concluded that campus surveillance is used beyond the purpose of preventing crime. 
      It is used to investigate on campus protests and activism and to monitor a student’s daily activities in hopes of using the data to prevent a 
      mental health crisis. In certain classrooms, bluetooth beacons are installed around the room to log student attendance. 
      Once the student leaves the classroom, Wi-fi access points around campus track 
      wherever they go 24 hours a day. Some of these universities are attempting to use this data 
      to evaluate one’s mental health and determine whether they are going through a mental health 
      crisis. For example, if a student hasn’t left their dorm room and skipped class for a week, 
      this information could be shared with their RA or adviser to check in on them. However, 
      universities do not have the capacity and technology to use this data to infer such results 
      yet. Therefore, is it just to use these technologies with the purpose of preventing health 
      crises when campus technology isn’t that advanced? Is this an invasion of privacy? And 
      should surveillance be used for the purposes of tracking and investigating criminal activity 
      only?  	
    </p>
    <p> The more concerning aspect of campus surveillance isn’t the surveillance itself, 
      rather, it’s the students’ lack of knowledge about the different ways they are being 
      surveilled. Across American universities, students either do not know about these methods 
      or they know they exist but not for the purpose of tracking their mental health and wellbeing 
      or they’re just now finding out through social media. There’s often little to no justification
      why a university needs such technology other than novelty or asserted convenience, but if they
      do use these technologies and for purposes other than campus safety, students should be made
      aware.
