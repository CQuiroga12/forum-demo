      <h1>Emergence of Surveillance Technology</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">In the past couple of decades, increase in campus crimes and school shootings has led administrators and campus safety to seek new methods of surveillance in hopes of providing a safer campus. Today, these methods can range from body-worn cameras to gunshot detectors, automated license plate readers to advanced biometric software to verify student eligibility to dine in the dining hall. While these technologies are sought with the intention of providing a safer campus and preventing crimes, they often end up used for other purposes and fail to respect students’ privacy. The following are examples of the technology used on college campuses:

      <h1>Use of Surveillance Technology</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">A recent study conducted by “...” determined that  campus police have adopted new technologies to investigate on campus protests and activism. This study also found that technology is now being used to monitor a student’s daily activities in hopes of using that data to prevent a mental health crisis. In certain classrooms across the United States, bluetooth beacons are installed around the room to log whether a student was present for class, late, left early, or absent. Once the student leaves the classroom, Wi-fi access points around campus track wherever they go 24 hours a day. Some of these universities are attempting to use this data to evaluate one’s mental health and determine whether they are going through a mental health crisis. For example, if a student hasn’t left their form room and attended class for a week, this information could be shared with their RA or adviser to check in on them. However, universities do not have the capacity and technology to use this data to infer such results yet. Therefore, is it just to use these technologies with the purpose of preventing health crises when campus technology isn’t that advanced? Is this an invasion of privacy? And should surveillance be used for the purposes of tracking and investigating criminal activity only?
</h5>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The more concerning aspect of campus surveillance isn’t the surveillance itself, rather, it’s the students’ lack of knowledge about the different ways they are being surveilled. Across American universities, students either do not know about these methods or they know they exist but not for the purpose of tracking their mental health and wellbeing or they’re just now finding out through social media. There’s often little to no justification why a university needs such technology other than novelty or asserted convenience, but if they do use these technologies and for purposes other than campus safety, students should be made aware.
