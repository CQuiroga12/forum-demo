      <h2>Increase in Surveillance</h2>
      <p>
        The presence of technology, specifically surveillance technology, in schools has changed due to the nature of the COVID-19
      pandemic. These technologies have been implemented under the claim that they are protecting students who are studying in-person.
      Some of these technologies might screen for coronavirus symptoms at particular places or times, continuously monitor students’
      location or health, or share data with local health departments. These COVID-19 protective measures also require additives that
      also protect student privacy. If these measures are solely intended for student protection against COVID-19, that means the information
      collected from these technologies cannot be used in other ways, like to incriminate students. Lastly, as time goes on, the presence
      of these technologies will become normalized and thought of as part of the school experience when they are quite the contrary.

        <h2> COVID-19 Surveillance </h2>
        <p>
        In order to monitor outbreaks, some schools have begun screening their students (as well as faculty and staff usually) for COVID-19.
         Some schools have also introduced required COVID-19 testing, which can range from monthly, biweekly, to weekly. For example,
        during the Spring 2021 semester, Davidson College required weekly COVID-19 testing for its students at the on-site Davidson College
        Student Testing Center. The process involved college student identification cards to record the student’s participation in testing
        and the use of a sensitive RT-PCR test. Davidson College student indentification cards are called CatCards.These cards are used to
        not only record student participation in weekly COVID-19 testing, but gain access to buildings and the cafeteria as a meal swipe.
        </p>

        <p>
        During one of Davidson's mid-semester breaks, administration used locational data connected to CatCard swipes to determine which students left or remained on campus.
        While this was a simple statistic used in one of the college's weekly COVID-19 emails, it signifies that Davidson College was monitoring students' locations.
        This monitoring is framed as preventive measures against an outbreak, but the question arises of what colleges like Davidson could do with this information?
        Students were not made aware that locational data connected to their CatCards would be analyzed to determine their whereabouts. Students were encouraged not to go off campus
        for this break, so imagine if Davidson used this information to push students they assumed had left by their lack of CatCard swipes.
        </p>

        <p>
        During the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 semester,
        Davidson College restricted access to residencies so that students only had access to the building they lived in. If one swiped into a building that was not their own, they would
        receive an email from the Dean of Students reminding them of the COVID-19 policies. Again, this scenario points to Davidson College's analysis of CatCard data to obtain
        students' locations, and thus monitor their behavior. It is assumed that Davidson College is one of many universities doing this in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
        Davidson's lack of transperancy in how they examine CatCard data and students' lack of knowledge of these practices contribute to school surveillance. Davidson College
        has the power to observe and to punish if they deem fit. This is important to think about when we acknowledge colleges are microcosms of society, therefore they are not
        excluded from the consequences of the heteropatriarchal, colonial-settler, and white supremacy society we all participate in. Hence, when colleges like Davidson utilize surveillance
        to punish, it will most certainly disproporationately impact their marginalized students. So, we should all start thinking and caring more about school surveillance before we start
        to accept it as the norm.

        This informational section does not speak on the rise of online proctored exams several universities implemented to prevent cheating. However, it is
        worth acknowledging that the technology involved in online proctored exams is extremely invasive of students' privacies and the epitome of surveillance. We encourage you
        to read more about it online.
