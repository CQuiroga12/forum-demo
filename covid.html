  <h1>School Surveillance and COVID-19</h1>

        The presence of technology, specifically surveillance technology, in schools has changed due to the nature of the COVID-19
      pandemic. These technologies have been implemented under the claim that they are protecting students who are studying in-person.
      Some of these technologies might “screen for coronavirus symptoms at particular places or times, continuously monitor students’
      location or health, or share data with local health departments.” These COVID-19 protective measures also require additives that
      also protect student privacy. If these measures are solely intended for student protection against COVID-19, that means the information
      collected from these technologies cannot be used in other ways, like to incriminate students. Lastly, as time goes on, the presence
      of these technologies will become normalized and thought of as part of the school experience when they are quite the contrary.

        In order to monitor outbreaks, some schools have begun screening their students (as well as faculty and staff usually) for COVID-19. These
      screenings can consist of daily temperature checks and/or completing a symptom questionnaire through a campus app, which “provided a
      “green pass” for entering campus buildings if the students were symptom free”. Some schools have also introduced required COVID-19
      testing, which can range from monthly, biweekly, to weekly. For example, during the Spring 2021 semester, Davidson College required
      weekly COVID-19 testing for its students at the on-site Davidson College Student Testing Center. The process involved college student
      identification cards to record the student’s participation in testing and the use of a “sensitive RT-PCR test”.
